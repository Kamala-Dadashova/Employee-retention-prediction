# Employee Turnover Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict employee turnover by analyzing a dataset of 14,999 employee records. The project includes data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model development to identify key factors driving employee turnover and provide actionable insights to improve retention strategies.

## Features

- **Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:** Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Developed and fine-tuned models including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
- **Model Optimization:** Utilized grid search and cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization, resulting in a relatively highly accurate model.


## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy:** For numerical computing.
- **scikit-learn:** For building and fine-tuning machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
- **matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **seaborn:** For advanced data visualization.

## Usage

After installing the required libraries, you can run the scripts provided in this repository. The main scripts include:

- `KD_Employee retention project.ipynb`: Contains the code for data analysis, feature engineering, model construction and model evaluation.
- `HR_data.csv`: Data
- `Exective summary about employee retention.pdf`: Outline results and provide insights based on the analysis.
